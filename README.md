In this project we created a basic command line calculator in python, you are able to: add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers to get the correct answer. we also added a loop into the mix to ask if you would like to continue with your calculations, this was done using a 'while' loop. we also allowed the program to raise some errors if non-defined operators were used and if you tried to input a 'string' instead of an 'integer' or 'float'.

How to use the calculator?
As you might have guessed it's no different to any other calculator...run the program, enter your first number when prompted, choose your operator(+,-,*,/), then enter your second number and wait for your result!# Group-Calculator-Hackathon
